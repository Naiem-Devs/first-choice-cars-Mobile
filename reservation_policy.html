                            <h6>At First Choice Cars, we strive to provide our customers with a hassle-free and transparent experience when buying or selling a pre-owned car. We're committed to delivering the highest quality of service possible and ensuring our customers' satisfaction. <br>
                                Our reservation policy is designed to ensure that the vehicle you desire is available for purchase when you're ready to make a final decision.</h6>
                            <h6>Deposit Amount and Duration of Reservation</h6>
                            <p>To reserve a used car or commercial vehicle at First Choice Cars, a deposit of a minimum of AED 2000 is required. In the case of a cash deal, the reservation period is 72 hours, while bank-financed deals have a reservation period of 7 working days. This deposit is non-refundable if the buyer fails to complete the financial dues agreed upon within the specified period. If the buyer fails to complete the purchase within that time, the reservation will be canceled, and the deposit forfeited. This doesn’t include if the bank finance is rejected or the finance terms are not up to the buyer's expectations.</p>
                            <h6>Reservation Process</h6>
                            <p>To reserve a vehicle, the customer must visit our showroom and fill out a reservation form, providing personal and vehicle details. The customer must also pay the minimum AED 2000 deposit to complete the reservation. Alternatively, the customer can reserve a vehicle online by filling out the reservation form on our website and making a secure online payment of the deposit amount.</p>
                            <h6>Reservation Cancellation</h6>
                            <p>At First Choice Cars, we prioritize providing our customers with high-quality used cars and commercial vehicles, and we stand behind the vehicles we sell. We understand that unexpected issues may arise, which is why we strive to be transparent and fair in our deposit policy. <br>
                                When a customer reserves a vehicle, the deposit is non-refundable unless certain conditions are met. For example, if the RTA inspection shows major mechanical defects that make the vehicle not roadworthy, we will refund the deposit. However, if First Choice Cars agree to repair the defects upon sale and final settlement, the deposit will not be refunded.</p>
                            <p>It's important to note that wear and tear, consumables, and service-related items are not considered major mechanical defects and therefore do not qualify for a deposit refund if requested. We encourage our customers to thoroughly inspect and research their vehicle before making a reservation to ensure they are confident in their decision to purchase.</p>
                            <p>In the event that the RTA inspection finds that the vehicle was involved in a major accident affecting its structure and safety, the deposit will be refundable. However, if the inspection finds visual defects such as scratches, dents, and refurbishment repaint work, the deposit will not be refundable.
                                We want our customers to feel confident in their decision to purchase, which is why our sales team is always available to answer any questions or concerns about our deposit policy and the RTA inspection process. We strive to provide transparent and fair policies that prioritize the safety and satisfaction of our customers.
                                It's important to note that deposits are strictly non-refundable if the buyer decides not to proceed with the purchase of the vehicle. This doesn’t include if the bank finance is rejected or the finance terms are not up to the buyer's expectations.</p>
                            <h6>Inspection and Test Drive</h6>
                            <p>At First Choice Cars, we understand that purchasing a used car or commercial vehicle can be a significant investment. That's why we encourage our customers to thoroughly inspect and test drive any vehicle they're interested in before making a purchase.</p>
                            <p>Our inspection process includes a rigorous RTA inspection to ensure the vehicle is roadworthy and free from any major mechanical defects that would affect its safety and performance. However, it's important to note that wear and tear, consumables, and service-related items are not considered major mechanical defects. Therefore, they do not qualify for a deposit refund if requested.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the RTA inspection, we also offer our customers the opportunity to take the vehicle for a test drive before making a purchase. This allows you to experience the vehicle firsthand and get a feel for its performance and features.</p>
                            <p>During the test drive, we encourage our customers to pay close attention to the vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, and overall comfort. This is also an excellent opportunity to test out any features or technologies that may be important to you, such as the audio system, climate control, and navigation system.</p>
                            <p>We understand that every customer's needs and preferences are unique, which is why we offer a wide selection of used cars and commercial vehicles to choose from. Our knowledgeable sales team is always available to answer any questions you may have about a particular vehicle or its features.</p>
                            <p>We encourage our customers to take advantage of our inspection and test drive process to ensure they make an informed decision and purchase a vehicle that meets their needs and budget.</p>
                            <p>For further questions or concerns about our inspection and test drive process, our sales team is always available to assist. We're committed to your satisfaction and look forward to helping you find the perfect vehicle for your needs.</p>
                            <h6>Financing</h6>
                            <p>At First Choice Cars, we understand that financing can be a major consideration when purchasing a used car or commercial vehicle. That's why we make car financing easy through our partnerships with leading UAE banks and other financial providers.</p>
                            <p>Due to our scale, we offer easy installment plans and enjoy the most competitive rates available. However, it's important to arrange for financing before the reservation period expires to ensure that you're able to complete the purchase within the specified time frame.</p>
                            <p>It's important to note that if the buyer does not proceed with the purchase of the vehicle after reserving it, the deposit is non-refundable. This doesn’t include if the bank finance is rejected or the finance terms are not up to the buyer's expectations. We encourage our customers to carefully consider their decision and inspect and research the vehicle thoroughly before reserving a vehicle.</p>
                            <p>We understand that financing can be a major concern, and we strive to make it as easy and stress-free as possible. Our sales team is always available to assist you with the financing process and answer any questions you may have.</p>
                            <h6>Finalizing the Purchase</h6>
                            <p>Finalizing the purchase of a used car or commercial vehicle is an important decision, and we want to make the process as smooth and stress-free as possible for our customers.</p>
                            <p>Once you've reserved a vehicle with a deposit, our sales team will work with you to finalize the purchase. If you're financing the vehicle, we'll assist you in arranging for financing before the reservation period expires. This will help ensure that you're able to complete the purchase within the specified time frame.</p>
                            <p>When you're ready to complete the purchase, the deposit will be adjusted from the total price of the vehicle. You'll need to pay the remaining amount and complete the necessary paperwork to transfer ownership. Our sales team will guide you through the process and answer any questions you may have.</p>
                            <p>At First Choice Cars, we're committed to delivering the highest quality of service possible, and we want our customers to feel confident and satisfied with their vehicle purchases. If you have any questions or concerns about the finalization process, our sales team is always available to assist you.</p>
                            <h6>Conclusion</h6>
