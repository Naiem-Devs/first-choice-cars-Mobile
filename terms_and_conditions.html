                                RESERVATION FEE</b>
                            <p>Reservation is only available to vehicles advertised on www.firstchoicecars.com, where the car is advertised with the reservation fee option. To secure a reservation, a Reservation Fee of AED 1000 can be paid in cash by calling us at the mentioned telephone number in the vehicle advert or by visiting our showroom at Souq Al Haraj, Al Ruqa Al Hamra, Showroom No. 70, P.O. Box 26011, Sharjah, UAE, or by directly depositing the reservation fee in our company account and emailing us the deposit slip at accounts@firstchoicecars.ae. We shall issue an acknowledgment receipt against the reservation fee and mention the Vehicle's details. The Customer must also provide their name, Emirates ID no., passport no., mobile no., and email address. Once the Reservation Fee of AED 1000 is confirmed as paid and acknowledged as received, FIRST CHOICE CARS will reserve the Vehicle at its showroom for 48 hrs unless extended by the Buyer and approved by us. If you cannot visit the car showroom to view the car within 48 hrs, a reservation extension must be made regarding when you could come. Within 48 hrs of the Reservation being confirmed as being paid, the Customer must make an appointment to view the Vehicle.</p>

                            <b>An appointment shall be either of the following:</b>
                            <ul class="alfabt">
                                <li> a) Attending the car showroom to view the Vehicle or</li>
                                <li> b) Calling and fixing an appointment at the telephone number mentioned in the vehicle advert.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When a customer attends the Car Showroom and decides to Purchase the Vehicle by completing an Order Form, the Reservation Fee will be applied to the purchase price of that Vehicle. Where a customer attends an appointment and notifies the Car Showroom on the appointment day that they do not want to purchase the Vehicle, the Reservation Fee shall be forfeited. However, where the vehicle inspection finds mechanical faults or accidents (does not include refurbishment paint from scratches or wear and tear minor items, consumables & tires), the Reservation Fee shall be refunded by cash or online transfer to your account within five working days. The Buyer can choose another vehicle when visiting the showroom for the initial car he selected on the website. Finance Buyers must provide all the bank-required documents within seven working days. Otherwise, it would be considered a forfeit, and the deposit will not be refunded unless agreed otherwise on the deposit invoice.</p>
